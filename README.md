## Bookings

### Overview

This app is a simple password tracker. Each entry has a url, a password and a username. Authentication is via email confirmation and sign in via a form. A current shortcoming is that all users can see all passwords. This will be improved in a future version.

### Implementation Details

password_tracker was implemented using BDD, CRUD from scratch and Devise.
